  - Affects combat chances based on size?
  - Should it affect combat if attack/defense genes are active?

## Diseases

Random epidemic events, contagion, remmision.

  - Multiplies energy decrease if sick?

## Sleep/Hibernation

Sleeps to restore energy if it is low.

  - Vulnerable to predators while sleeping?

## Plants Grow

Plants can grow, increaseing their energy intake.

  - Maximum energy settings?
  - Affects decayed energy?

## World

  - Rock obstacle
  - Day/Night cycles (affects plants grow, movement speed, sleep?)

## Hunters

## Babies

Should creatures ever go back to baby state?

  - Always, depending on the energy state?
