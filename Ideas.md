To-Dos
======

  - Log energy gained after a meal.
  - Maximum energy setting for creatures.
  - Recovery time for combat.
  - Dedicated combat settings to unclutter attack/defense settings?
  - Combat energy cost also if attack/defense are inactive?
  - Recovery time also if attack/defense are inactive?
  - Transform attack/defense values in chance multiplier (chance *= attack-defense)?

Ideas
=====

## Size Gene

Multiplier affecting scaling of the creature.

  - Scaling only effective for adults?
  - Should it affect speed? Slower if larger, faster if smaller?
  - Should it affect energy decrease? More if larger, less if smaller?
  - Affects combat chances based on size?
  - Should it affect combat if attack/defense genes are active?

## Diseases

Random epidemic events, contagion, remmision.

  - Multiplies energy decrease if sick?

## Sleep/Hibernation

Sleeps to restore energy if it is low.

  - Vulnerable to predators while sleeping?

## Plants Grow

Plants can grow, increaseing their energy intake.

  - Maximum energy settings?
  - Affects decayed energy?

## World

  - Rock obstacle
  - Day/Night cycles (affects plants grow, movement speed, sleep?)

## Hunters

Can attack predators and vampires.

## Babies

Should creatures ever go back to baby state?

  - Always, depending on the energy state?
  - After reproduction, depending on the energy state?
  - If after reproduction, only for mitosis?

## Prey Sense

Should it detect defense value on targets?

## Coprophagia

New diet gene/creature class.  
Uses manure as food source.

  - Remove ability to eat manure for scavengers?

## Zombies

Zombies donâ€™t need energy to live, yet still attack other creatures.  
Attacked creatures may die or turn into a zombie.
Other creatures will always try to fight back, regardless of their class.
